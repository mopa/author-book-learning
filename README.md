# Author-Book App for Learning Purposes

The motivation for this repository is to provide an easy way to learn how to implement **design patterns** and **architectures** in a real world application. 

The `main` branch is the basic starting point of the journey. Navigate through the branches to see the evolution of the application. Our first stop is in the `feat/repository-pattern`.
